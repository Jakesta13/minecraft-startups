# Minecraft-Startups
## Just a bunch of custom-made start.sh scripts for minecraft.


I mostly have this repo to host the files that my current or future minecraft setups that would want to download
in order to start whatever setup I want (Plugin based, etc).

Feel free to grab one for your own use.
